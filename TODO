- fix properties focus issue (change value, click Set)

make our own live view
- move by dragging
- move z by scrolling
- auto-contrast

Issues:
Thread problem in RunTo (two competing threads)
Update Live View has problems
PiUsb crashes upon exit
Update positions once per second if not moving

Drivers:
IIDC Camera (work with Gunnsted, maybe NI driver)

Hardware:
Chamber (O ring fitting not wide enough so objectives do not fit)
Sample holder arm needs adjusting

Nice to have:
Motor control of the mirrors, slit, iris
Better OOM handling in MMCore
