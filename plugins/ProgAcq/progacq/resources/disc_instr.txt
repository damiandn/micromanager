Enter any sequence of the following patterns to generate values:
<ul>
  <li>MATLAB-style ranges: <code>(min : max : step)</code></li>
  <li>Arrays of values: <code>[a, b, c, ...]</code></li>
  <li>Value repeaters: <code>{value, count}</code></li>
</ul>
Make sure the number of values is as expected (data outside the<br/>
above formats is discarded silently!), and is the same for each<br/>
device. <b>Note:</b> Unlike elsewhere, rows generated by this dialog do<br/>
<i>not</i> cascade. (That is, the number of generated rows is the number of<br/>
values produced by any one box.)
